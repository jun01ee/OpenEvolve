The current `f(x)` is a simple Lorentzian function, 1/(1+x^2). While it's smooth and has a known Fourier transform (also a Lorentzian), it might not be the most optimal function for minimizing the uncertainty product Q = I1 * I2 under the normalization constraint. Intuitively, we want a function that is \"compact\" in both the spatial and frequency domains, as this minimizes the spread in both. A Gaussian is the classic example of such a function, and is a strong baseline. Let's try to refine our candidate by introducing parameters.\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Gaussian Motivation:** A Gaussian function g(x) = exp(-a*x^2) is known to minimize the uncertainty product. This arises from the Fourier transform of a Gaussian also being a Gaussian. The `a` parameter controls the width of the Gaussian in the spatial domain.\n2. **Parameterized Lorentzian:** The current function is a Lorentzian. We can modify this by introducing a scaling parameter to see its impact on the objective. Let's make it f(x) = 1 / (1 + a*x*x), where `a` can be a hyperparameter. Although the result may not be better than the Gaussian, this approach will help the genetic programming algorithm learn.\n3. **Parameter Optimization:** Ultimately, an optimizer would tune this a. It seems like using a variable and exposing the variable through the function call is the way to introduce an improvement here.\n\nHere's the code change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function\n    return 1 / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
