To improve the fitness score (which is likely based on how close the algorithm gets to the actual minimum), we can incorporate a more informed search strategy.  The function `f(x) = x**x` has a minimum near `x = 1/e`.  We can combine a coarse random search to explore the space with a local search around a more promising region.\n\n1.  **Narrowed Initial Search Range:** The initial random search range is narrowed to focus the initial exploration on a more relevant area.\n2.  **Local Refinement (Gradient Descent like step):** After the initial random search, the algorithm performs a local refinement using a step towards the direction of the derivative of f(x) = x\\*\\*x. This aims to converge the solution faster to the minimum.\n\n**Diffs:**\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    best_x = 1.0\n    best_val = best_x ** best_x\n    for _ in range(50):\n        x = random.uniform(1e-5, 2.0)\n        val = x ** x\n        if val < best_val:\n            best_x, best_val = x, val\n    return best_x\n=======\n    best_x = 1.0\n    best_val = best_x ** best_x\n    # Initial random search with narrower range\n    for _ in range(50):\n        x = random.uniform(0.01, 1.5)\n        val = x ** x\n        if val < best_val:\n            best_x, best_val = x, val\n\n    # Local Refinement (Gradient Descent like step)\n    learning_rate = 0.01\n    for _ in range(20): #Reduce the search range\n        # Approximate derivative of x**x: x**x * (1 + ln(x))\n        derivative = best_val * (1 + math.log(best_x))\n        x_new = best_x - learning_rate * derivative\n        if 0 < x_new < 2.0:  # Ensure x remains positive and within a reasonable bound\n            val_new = x_new ** x_new\n            if val_new < best_val:\n                best_x, best_val = x_new, val_new\n            else:\n                # If step increases the value, reduce learning rate\n                learning_rate *= 0.9\n\n    return best_x\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
