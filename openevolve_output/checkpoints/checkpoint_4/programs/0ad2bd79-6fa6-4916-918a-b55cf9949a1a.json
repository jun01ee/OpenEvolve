The current score is -0.0063, which is the best observed score. However, there might be opportunities to further refine the Gaussian by adjusting its parameters or by introducing a slight modification to further smooth it.\n\nHere are a few suggestions:\n\n1.  **Adjusting the Gaussian's `sigma`:** The `sigma` parameter controls the width of the Gaussian. A smaller `sigma` leads to a narrower Gaussian, which concentrates the wavefunction in position space but spreads it in momentum space. A larger `sigma` does the opposite. The current `sigma = 1.0` might be a good balance, but exploring slightly different values could be beneficial.\n\n2.  **Introducing a slight exponential decay:** While a Gaussian is smooth, adding a very slight exponential decay term could further \"taper\" the wavefunction at its edges, potentially reducing high-momentum components without significantly increasing position spread. This is a delicate balance.\n\nLet's try adjusting the `sigma` first, as it's a direct parameter of the current successful approach.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Create the Gaussian\n    y = np.exp(-0.5 * (x / sigma)**2) + 0.0j\n=======\n    # Create the Gaussian\n    # Experiment with a slightly smaller sigma to see if it improves the balance\n    # between position and momentum spread.\n    sigma = 0.9  # Slightly reduced sigma\n    y = np.exp(-0.5 * (x / sigma)**2) + 0.0j\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning: The current program uses a Gaussian, which is a good choice for minimizing the uncertainty product due to its smooth edges. The `sigma` parameter controls the width of this Gaussian. By slightly reducing `sigma` from 1.0 to 0.9, we are making the Gaussian slightly narrower in position space. This could potentially lead to a better trade-off between the variance in position (`var_x`) and the variance in momentum (`var_xi`), ultimately improving the combined score. This is an exploration to fine-tune the existing successful approach."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
