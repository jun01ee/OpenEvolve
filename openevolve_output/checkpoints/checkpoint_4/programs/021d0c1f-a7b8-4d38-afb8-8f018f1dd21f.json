These sharp edges lead to a large spread in momentum space (high `var_xi`), as indicated by the current `var_xi` of 3.6062. To improve the fitness by reducing the Heisenberg Uncertainty Product (which is proportional to `var_x * var_xi`), we need to smooth these edges.\n\nA common way to smooth sharp edges is to use a Gaussian function. A Gaussian function is infinitely differentiable and has a well-behaved Fourier transform, which should reduce the momentum variance.\n\nHere's a proposed change to replace the boxcar function with a Gaussian function.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    width = 2.0\n    # Initialize with zeros\n    y = np.zeros_like(x, dtype=np.complex128)\n    \n    # Create the box\n    mask = (x > -width/2) & (x < width/2)\n    y[mask] = 1.0 + 0.0j\n=======\n    # Replace boxcar with a Gaussian function for smoother edges\n    # A Gaussian function has a well-behaved Fourier transform,\n    # which should reduce momentum variance (var_xi).\n    sigma = 1.0  # Standard deviation of the Gaussian\n    # Initialize with zeros\n    y = np.zeros_like(x, dtype=np.complex128)\n    \n    # Create the Gaussian\n    y = np.exp(-0.5 * (x / sigma)**2) + 0.0j\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
