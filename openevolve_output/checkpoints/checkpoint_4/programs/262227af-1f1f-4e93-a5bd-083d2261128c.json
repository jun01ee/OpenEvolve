I increased this to 100. More iterations allow for a more thorough search of the space, potentially finding a better minimum.\n2.  **Reduced Search Space:** The original code searched from `1e-5` to `2.0`.  The function `x**x` has a minimum near `x = 0.367879`. I changed the search space to `0.01` to `1.5`. This focuses the search near the expected minimum, increasing the likelihood of finding a better value within the given number of iterations.\n3.  **No change to the core logic:** The core logic (calculating `val` and comparing it to `best_val`) remains the same. This ensures the function still correctly minimizes `x**x`.\n\nThese changes aim to improve the function's ability to find a lower value of `x**x` (and therefore a better fitness score) by focusing the search and increasing the number of attempts.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
