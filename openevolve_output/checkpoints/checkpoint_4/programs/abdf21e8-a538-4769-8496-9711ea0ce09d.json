This function is a good starting point because it is smooth, decays reasonably well in both the position and frequency domains, and has closed-form Fourier transform. However, its performance is currently at 0.0000, indicating it's not well-optimized for the given objective. The goal is to improve the function to minimize the product of the position-space and frequency-space variances, subject to normalization. This is closely related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.\n\nThe key to improving this lies in manipulating the function's parameters to better balance the spread in position and frequency domains. We can introduce a parameter to control the \"width\" of the function, which will affect the variances. A Gaussian function is known to have the minimum possible product of position and frequency variances, and we can move closer to that ideal shape.\n\nHere's how we'll proceed:\n\n1.  **Introduce a parameter `a`:** We'll introduce a parameter `a` to control the \"width\" of the function.  This parameter will scale the x variable inside the function.\n2.  **Modify the function:**  We will modify the Cauchy function to incorporate the parameter `a`.\n3.  **Keep the search_algorithm unchanged:** The `search_algorithm` function remains the same, as the mutation will happen inside the f() function.\n\nHere's the code with the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Introduce a parameter 'a' to control the width.
