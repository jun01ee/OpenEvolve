The current program uses a Gaussian function. The objective is to minimize the product of the \"spatial spread\" (I1) and the \"momentum spread\" (I2), subject to normalization. A Gaussian minimizes this product, which is a key property of the Gaussian in the context of the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe core idea for improvement would be to try functions that are known to be localized and have well-defined Fourier transforms and closed-form (or nearly closed form) expressions. Specifically, a few options arise:\n\n1.  **Gaussian with tunable width**: We can introduce a parameter into the Gaussian. As seen from previous examples, controlling the width of a Gaussian will affect the I1 and I2 values.\n\n2.  **Cauchy-Lorentz distribution**: A Cauchy distribution is another possibility. It is smooth, localized, and has a well-defined Fourier transform. We can introduce scaling parameter to explore different widths for the function and try to achieve some optimal balance between I1 and I2, similar to the Gaussian case.\n\n3.  **Super Gaussian**: This could be used to make the Gaussian more localized by having sharper tails (and therefore higher frequency content), but such an approach is beyond what is considered \"elegant.\"\n\nConsidering the previous approaches, I'll go for the tunable Gaussian approach, to keep it as simple and efficient as possible and to utilize what worked earlier.\n\nHere's the code change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function - well localized\n    return np.exp(-x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function with tunable width.\n    a = 1.0  # Width parameter (can be optimized by the evolutionary search).\n    return (1 / np.sqrt(a * np.pi)) * np.exp(-(x*x)/a)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
