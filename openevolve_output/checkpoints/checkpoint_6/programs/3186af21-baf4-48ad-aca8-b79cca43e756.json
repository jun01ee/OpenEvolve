This is a good starting point because Gaussians are well-behaved, smooth, and have well-defined Fourier transforms (also Gaussians).  The objective function's integrals (I1 and I2) are related to the spread in position and momentum space.  The product of these, along with the normalization constraint, links directly to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  A Gaussian, as a minimum uncertainty wavepacket, should be a good solution (or at least close).  The parameter `a` controls the width of the Gaussian, which impacts the uncertainty relation.  We need to find the best `a` and/or explore other functions.\n\nSince the fitness score is currently 1000, and is the same as the previous attempt, we will focus on ways to improve this and make the program more versatile. One way to do this is to add a parameter for the center of the Gaussian. Although the center does not change the integrals I1, I2, it will show how the new OpenEvolve can manipulate this and other parameters.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, x0=0.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*(x-x0)*(x-x0))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
