The current program uses a Lorentzian function, `f(x, a) = 1 / (1 + a*x*x)`.  This is a reasonable starting point.  Lorentzians are smooth, decay nicely, and are easy to work with analytically, at least in principle.  However, let's think about how to improve the fitness related to the two integrals and the normalization constraint.\n\nThe integrals involve `x^2 |f(x)|^2` and `\u03be^2 |f\u0302(\u03be)|^2`. We know that `f\u0302(\u03be)` is also a Lorentzian, just with a different parameter (and a scaling factor). This symmetry is good. The integral `I1` is likely tractable.  The integral `I2` will involve the Fourier transform of a Lorentzian, which is another Lorentzian. So, mathematically, it's pretty nice.\n\nTo improve the program, here's my plan:\n\n1.  **Adjust the parameter `a`:** The original value is 1.0. Let's make `a` a tunable parameter, because it will affect the width in x-space and its conjugate width in Fourier space.\n2.  **Add a scaling factor:** Let's also include a scaling factor that ensures normalization is easier to control (the current program may be a poor normalizer).\n\nHere is the code change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function\n    return 1 / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, c=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function, with scaling\n    return c / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
