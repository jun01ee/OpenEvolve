The best performing programs (Program 1 and Program 2) also use Gaussians. Program 1 has `sigma = width / 4.0` and Program 2 has `sigma = width / 3.0`. Both achieve the best score.\n\nTo improve fitness, we should explore variations that further smooth the wavefunction or adjust the balance between position and momentum space. A common way to smooth a Gaussian is to add a small damping factor or to use a more complex function that approximates a Gaussian but has slightly different properties.\n\nGiven that the current `sigma` values are `width/4.0` and `width/3.0`, let's try a slightly larger sigma to see if it further reduces the momentum variance, or perhaps introduce a more complex shape.\n\nLet's try a slightly wider Gaussian by increasing `sigma`. This should reduce the spread in position space, potentially leading to a narrower spread in momentum space.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Replace boxcar with a Gaussian\n    sigma = width / 4.0 # Adjust sigma to control the width of the Gaussian\n    y = np.exp(-x**2 / (2 * sigma**2)) + 0.0j\n=======\n    # Replace boxcar with a Gaussian\n    # Increasing sigma further to see if it reduces momentum variance\n    sigma = width / 2.5 # Experimenting with a larger sigma\n    y = np.exp(-x**2 / (2 * sigma**2)) + 0.0j\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Reasoning:**\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position ($\\Delta x$) and momentum ($\\Delta p$) is bounded from below. A Gaussian function is known to be the minimum uncertainty state for this product. The current program uses a Gaussian. By increasing `sigma`, we are making the Gaussian wider in position space. This intuitively might lead to a narrower spread in momentum space, thereby reducing the uncertainty product. The previous best programs used `sigma = width / 4.0` and `sigma = width / 3.0`. We are trying `sigma = width / 2.5` which is larger than both, aiming for a better balance."]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
