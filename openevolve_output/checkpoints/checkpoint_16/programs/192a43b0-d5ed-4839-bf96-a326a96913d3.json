The Gaussian minimizes the product of the position and momentum variances, aligning well with the uncertainty principle, and leading to relatively small values of both I1 and I2, and therefore a good combined score. However, we can potentially improve the program by adding another parameter to control the width and amplitude independently. Another option would be to explore a function that combines Gaussian and sinusoidal behavior. Considering the current program structure, and to encourage more exploration, let us introduce a second parameter `b`.
