This is a good starting point because Gaussian functions are well-behaved in both the spatial and frequency domains, a key aspect of minimizing the product of the two integral quantities in the problem. The parameter 'a' controls the width of the Gaussian, which directly influences the values of I1 and I2.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the current program and suggested improvements:\n\n*   **Current Program Analysis:**\n\n    *   `f(x, a=1.0)`:  A Gaussian function. The use of `a` is appropriate. The normalization factor `(a/np.pi)**0.25` is correct to ensure the integral of |f(x)|^2 equals 1.\n    *   `search_algorithm()`: Returns `f`. This is correct for the problem setup.\n\n*   **Improvements:**\n\n    1.  **Explore Different Parameterizations:** While the Gaussian form is ideal, we can explore how `a` impacts the integrals and potentially introduce more parameters or modifications to control the shape subtly.\n    2.  **Consider Higher-Order Functions:** Could consider Hermite functions (eigenfunctions of the quantum harmonic oscillator). Although more complex, they can provide a richer set of solutions, especially if the optimization favors solutions that are not pure Gaussians.\n    3.  **Introduce a Phase Factor:** Experiment with a complex-valued function by adding a phase factor. This does not directly affect the magnitude squared, so the normalization remains valid, but it could subtly influence the integrals.\n\nHere's the first suggested change incorporating option 1 above:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (related to width).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a/np.pi)**0.25 * np.exp(-a * x**2)\n=======\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (related to width).
