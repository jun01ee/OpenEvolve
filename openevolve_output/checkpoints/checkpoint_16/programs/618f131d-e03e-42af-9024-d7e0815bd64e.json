The current program uses a simple function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x**2)`. While this function is smooth, it might not be optimal for minimizing the product of the position and momentum variances, given the constraints.  We've seen Gaussian functions perform well in previous attempts. A Gaussian function naturally balances position and momentum spread, making it a good candidate. Let's modify the program to use a Gaussian function.\n\nHere's the suggested change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, sigma=1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function.

This form has a known relationship between its width in position space and its width in momentum space (through the Fourier transform), offering a better starting point for optimizing the uncertainty product.\n2.  **Normalization:** The Gaussian function is explicitly normalized to ensure the integral of |f(x)|^2 over the real line is 1, satisfying the problem's constraint.\n3.  **Parameterization:** The `sigma` parameter controls the width (and therefore the uncertainty) of the Gaussian.  This provides a degree of freedom for the evolutionary algorithm to tune the function.\n4.  **NumPy:** Uses NumPy for efficient numerical calculations of the exponential and square root.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
