The current program defines a Gaussian function. This is a good starting point because it is smooth and well-behaved, and its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, providing a natural link between the x and \u03be domains. The key to improving the fitness score (specifically, the product of I1 and I2) likely involves fine-tuning the balance between the function's spread in position space (x) and momentum space (\u03be). This balance is governed by the uncertainty principle. We know that the Gaussian is already optimal in terms of minimizing the uncertainty product.\n\nThe existing code has a parameter `sigma` that controls the width of the Gaussian.  This is excellent, and it is parameterized correctly using `sigma^2` inside of the exponential term.\n\nHowever, the question requires an explicit search parameter that will be tuned by the optimization.
