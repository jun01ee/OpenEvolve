The current `f(x)` is a simple Lorentzian function, `1 / (1 + x*x)`.  This is a valid candidate but likely not optimal for minimizing the product of the position and momentum variances. The Gaussian function, as seen in the \"Inspiration\" examples, is known to minimize the uncertainty product, so we should consider exploring variations or combinations of this core idea.\n\nThe current code also lacks any adjustable parameters. We need to introduce at least one parameter to give the evolutionary search an option for optimizing function parameters. This will allow the optimizer to explore different \"widths\" or \"shapes\" of the function and therefore improve the value of I1 and I2, therefore Q.\n\nHere's a revised strategy:\n\n1.  **Introduce a parameter `a` to the Lorentzian function.** We will make it controllable.
