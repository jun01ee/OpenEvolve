The current program utilizes a normalized Gaussian function. Gaussian functions are a good starting point due to their well-behaved properties in both the spatial and Fourier domains, aligning with the problem's focus on minimizing both I1 and I2, and its relation to the uncertainty principle. The Gaussian minimizes the product of variances in position and momentum.\n\nThe program includes `sigma` as a parameter. This is good because `sigma` controls the spread in the x-domain, which also influences the spread in the frequency domain. So, we'll try to find an alternative parameterization that might improve the fitness score, by slightly altering the gaussian function to emphasize this relationship between spatial and frequency spreads.  The current parameterization is adequate, but a small adjustment might improve efficiency during the parameter optimization stage.\n\nHere's the plan: We'll retain the Gaussian form but refactor it slightly, potentially making it easier for the search algorithm to efficiently tune the function.
