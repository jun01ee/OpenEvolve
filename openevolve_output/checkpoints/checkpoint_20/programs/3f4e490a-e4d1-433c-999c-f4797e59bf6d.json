This is a good starting point because Gaussians are well-behaved and have known Fourier transforms (also Gaussian). The parameter `alpha` controls the spread. The normalization is correctly implemented.\n\n**Improvements and Reasoning:**\n\nThe core of the issue is to find a function that minimizes the product of the two integrals (I1 and I2).  The uncertainty principle tells us that a Gaussian minimizes this product. Therefore, the current program is already quite good, but we can refine it further.\n\n1.  **Exploration of Parameter Space:** While the current `alpha` parameter is good, we can explicitly define it as a parameter that will be tuned by the evolutionary algorithm. This is already implemented, so we don't need to change this part.\n\n2.  **Maintain Gaussian Form:** The most likely best solution is a Gaussian. Any deviation from a Gaussian will likely increase the product I1 \\* I2.\n\n3. **Clarity and Comments:** Improve comments to explain the role of parameters and the mathematical reasoning behind the choice.\n\nHere's the suggested change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    return (alpha / np.pi)**0.25 * np.exp(-alpha * x**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\n    # Gaussian function, normalized.
