This is a good starting point because Gaussian functions are well-behaved, smooth, and have well-defined Fourier transforms (also Gaussian).  The parameter `sigma` controls the width of the Gaussian, which directly influences the trade-off between the spatial and frequency domains (as governed by the uncertainty principle).\n\n**Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Introduce `a` as a Parameter:** While `sigma` is a fine parameter, using `a` directly in the exponent allows for a more direct connection to the integrals.  The current program uses `sigma` internally. Let's make `a` a primary parameter and then calculate `sigma` from it. This is a minor change but can potentially simplify the mental model for future parameter tuning.\n\n2. **Normalization Constant:**  The current program has a normalization factor.  We can simplify the function by directly using a form that has a known normalization.\n\n3.  **Efficiency and Readability:** Use `np.exp` for the exponential function and `np.pi` for pi.\n\nHere's the code with the proposed changes.\n\n```python\n# initial_program.py\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (related to width).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a/np.pi)**0.25 * np.exp(-a * x**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n```\n\nNow, let's express these changes in the required diff format.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function with a parameter for width\n    sigma = 1.0  # Initial guess for the standard deviation (width)\n    return (1 / (sigma * (2 * 3.141592653589793)**0.5)) *  2.718281828459045**(-(x**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (related to width).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a/np.pi)**0.25 * np.exp(-a * x**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
