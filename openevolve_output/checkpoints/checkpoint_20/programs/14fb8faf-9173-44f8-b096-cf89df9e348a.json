The current program utilizes a Lorentzian function: `f(x, a, c) = c / (1 + a*x*x)`.  Lorentzian functions are known to be localized in the x-domain, but their Fourier transforms decay relatively slowly. This suggests potentially larger values for `I2` compared to the Gaussian. The Gaussian, as seen in the previous attempts, is a good starting point because it minimizes the product of the variances in position and momentum (related to the uncertainty principle). Let's experiment by combining features from the existing attempts and introducing a parameter to control the \"shape\". Let's attempt to use the existing form and add a Gaussian modulation on top.\n\nHere's the plan: We modify the Lorentzian to include a Gaussian component as modulation. This might retain the localization of the Lorentzian in the x-domain while affecting the Fourier transform (hopefully increasing its decay) in a controlled way through parameterization.\n\nHere's the code changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, c=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function, with scaling\n    return c / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, c=1.0, b=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function, with scaling and Gaussian modulation\n    return c * np.exp(-b * x*x) / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
