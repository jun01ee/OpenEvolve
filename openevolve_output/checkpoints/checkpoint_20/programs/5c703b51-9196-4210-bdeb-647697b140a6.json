Gaussian functions are known to minimize the uncertainty product (a core concept related to the optimization objective). The parameter `sigma` controls the spread of the Gaussian.  The normalization ensures that the integral of |f(x)|^2 over all x is equal to 1, satisfying the problem's constraint.\n\nThe existing program is a good starting point. However, we can explore different parameterizations and slightly modify the functional form to see if it can improve the fitness. Specifically, we can modify the normalization factor and parameterize the Gaussian with a different variable, like 'a' which is inversely related to the variance.  This can lead to a more compact expression.\n\n**Improvements and Reasoning:**\n\nThe primary goal is to find a function that minimizes the product of the integral of x^2|f(x)|^2 and the integral of \u03be^2|f\u0302(\u03be)|^2. For a Gaussian function, this product is proportional to a constant, which is ideal.  The existing function already achieves this. However, we can experiment with different forms to find a slightly better solution or discover a parameterization that leads to a more optimized expression, which may improve the final fitness score.\n\nHere's the suggested change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, sigma=1.0):\n    # Gaussian function (normalized)\n    normalization = 1.0 / np.sqrt(2 * np.pi * sigma**2)\n    return normalization * np.exp(-(x**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n=======\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Gaussian function (normalized)\n    normalization = (a / np.pi)**0.25\n    return normalization * np.exp(-a * x**2)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\n\n1.  **Parameterization:** The `sigma` parameter is replaced with `a`.  `a` is inversely related to the variance.\n\n2.  **Normalization:** The normalization factor is changed to `(a / np.pi)**0.25`. This ensures the function remains normalized.\n\nThis modified Gaussian form is still a valid solution and may lead to a slightly better fitness score due to a more elegant parameterization. The change is designed to maintain the core properties of the Gaussian while offering a potential improvement in the parameterization and possibly the fitness.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
