The current program defines a Gaussian function. The Gaussian function is a good starting point because its Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, and it's well-behaved under the integral operations required by the fitness function. The parameter 'a' controls the width of the Gaussian in the x-domain.\n\nThe current normalization is almost correct, but it might be worth verifying if the prefactor calculation is truly exact for numerical stability. Let's make an adjustment to the prefactor to be more explicit. Also let's try a small change to the functional form to introduce a small, potentially beneficial, change to its spectral properties. This could potentially allow for more control over the width of the function in x space versus in frequency space.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Gaussian function, normalized.
