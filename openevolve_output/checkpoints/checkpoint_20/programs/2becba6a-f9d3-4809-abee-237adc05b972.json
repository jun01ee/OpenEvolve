The objective is to minimize the product of I1 and I2, subject to normalization. The Gaussian is already a good candidate, but we can explore variations that might offer a slightly better balance.\n\nThe key to improvement lies in adjusting the balance between spatial and spectral localization. The current program's f(x) is centered at x=0. We could try to shift its location while maintaining good spectral properties. This could potentially give better results in the integrals calculation.\n\nHere are a few possible refinements:\n\n1.  **Introduce a phase factor:** Add a complex exponential to the Gaussian to create a shifted Gaussian in the frequency domain. This is essentially equivalent to shifting the Gaussian in the spatial domain.\n2.  **Adjust the scaling** Slightly adjust the parameter `a`.\n\nHere's the first suggested change incorporating a phase factor, keeping the basic Gaussian structure.
