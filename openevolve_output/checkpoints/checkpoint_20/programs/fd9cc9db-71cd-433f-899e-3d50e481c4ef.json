Gaussian functions are well-behaved, smooth, and have a known Fourier transform (also a Gaussian). The key is to optimize the parameter `sigma` to minimize the product of the two integrals. The current program correctly identifies that `sigma` is the parameter to control the spread in the x-domain and consequently in the Fourier domain.\n\nThe main challenge is that the fitness function is computed externally, so we can't directly \"tune\" `sigma` within the code. However, we can introduce a *parameterized* Gaussian and provide a more explicit normalization for the function `f(x)`. This might help the external evaluator.\n\n**Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Normalization:** The current Gaussian is not normalized. Normalizing it explicitly will make the integral of |f(x)|^2 equal to 1, which directly addresses the problem's constraint.  This will make the external evaluation and optimization process more robust.\n\n2.  **Parameterization:** While `sigma` is already a parameter, we can make this more explicit. Also, we will use a single parameter `a` for the spread, which is more common.\n\nHere are the code modifications in the required `SEARCH/REPLACE` format.\n\n```diff\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, sigma):\n    # Gaussian function (unnormalized).\n    # Sigma controls the spread; smaller sigma -> more localized in x, wider in Fourier space (and vice-versa).\n    return np.exp(-(x**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a):\n    \"\"\"\n    Normalized Gaussian function.  'a' controls the spread.\n    Smaller 'a' -> wider in x, narrower in Fourier space.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (a / np.pi)**0.25 * np.exp(-a * x*x / 2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n*   **Normalization:**  The `(a / np.pi)**0.25` factor in front of the exponential normalizes the Gaussian. This is crucial for satisfying the constraint.\n*   **Parameterization:** The parameter `a` is used instead of sigma. The program description stated that the parameter `a` may be used.\n*   **Clarity:** The comments are updated to reflect the changes and the role of the parameter `a`.\n*   **Mathematical Structure:** The resulting function is still a Gaussian, preserving the desirable properties for this problem. The closed-form Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, making the integrals easier to evaluate (externally). The parameter `a` effectively controls the width of the Gaussian in both the spatial and frequency domains, directly influencing the uncertainty principle and the optimization objective.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
