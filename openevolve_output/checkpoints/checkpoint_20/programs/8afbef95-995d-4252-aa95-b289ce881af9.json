The goal is to find a function where the spread in x-space and the spread in Fourier space (\u03be-space) are \"balanced\" in a way that minimizes the product of the variances (related to the integrals I1 and I2).  A Gaussian function has this property.  We'll modify the original function to be more Gaussian-like.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Gaussian-like Behavior:** A Gaussian function `exp(-x^2)` has a Gaussian Fourier transform. This is optimal in terms of minimizing the uncertainty product.\n2.  **Normalization:** The original function isn't normalized. We'll add a normalization factor.\n3.  **Parameterization:** We introduce a parameter `a` to control the width of the Gaussian, allowing for flexibility in the function's shape.\n4. **Smoothness:** Gaussian functions are infinitely differentiable, ensuring smoothness, which is desirable.\n\nHere's the code with the suggested changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    A Gaussian-like function.
