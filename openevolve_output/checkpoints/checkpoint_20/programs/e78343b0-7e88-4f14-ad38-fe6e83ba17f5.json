This is a reasonable starting point. The goal is to minimize the product of the position and momentum variances. The Cauchy function has infinite variance in both position and momentum, which is not ideal. A Gaussian function is known to minimize the uncertainty principle.\n\n**Improvements and Reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Switch to a Gaussian:** The Gaussian function is the optimal solution for minimizing the product of position and momentum variances, as it minimizes the uncertainty principle. Replacing the Cauchy function with a Gaussian function will likely improve the fitness score, as the integrals I1 and I2 will be finite and their product will be lower compared to the Cauchy function.  We will parameterize the Gaussian with a width parameter `a`.\n\n2.  **Normalization:**  The Gaussian needs to be properly normalized to satisfy the condition `\u222b |f(x)|^2 dx = 1`. This is crucial for the evaluation of the integrals.\n\nHere's the code change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (standard deviation)\n    return (1 / (a * math.sqrt(2*math.pi))) * math.exp(-0.5 * (x / a)**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
