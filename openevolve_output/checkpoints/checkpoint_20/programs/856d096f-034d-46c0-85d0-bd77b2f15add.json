The current program uses a normalized Gaussian function. This is a good starting point because it's smooth, analytically tractable, and well-behaved in both position and frequency space. The key is to explore how to tune the parameter `a` to optimize the product of the uncertainties, Q.\n\nThe uncertainty principle tells us that a narrower Gaussian in position space will be wider in frequency space, and vice-versa. Therefore, the optimal `a` will likely be related to a balance between the spread in both domains.  Since we are using the square of x and the square of the Fourier transform variable, the Gaussian is a good solution and the parameter a controls the width of the Gaussian, and therefore the spread in both position and frequency space.\n\nThe current implementation is already good, but we can make it more explicit by adding a comment explaining the relationship between `a` and the width in both spaces.\n\nHere's the proposed change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Normalized Gaussian function\n    return math.sqrt(a/math.pi) * math.exp(-a * x * x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n=======\n    # Normalized Gaussian function.
