The current program uses a simple function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x*x)`. This is a Cauchy distribution (also known as a Lorentzian function), which is known for its heavy tails.  This might lead to a relatively large value for `I1` (due to the x^2 weighting) and a relatively small value for `I2` (as its Fourier transform is also a Lorentzian, with a narrow peak). The product `Q = I1 * I2` is what we want to minimize.  The key is to find a balance between the spatial and frequency domains.\n\nSince the Gaussian function is a good candidate, as seen in the previous attempts, I will try to incorporate it into this function.\n\nHere's the first set of changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Modified function combining Cauchy and Gaussian, parameterized by 'a'\n    return math.exp(-0.5 * (x / a)**2) / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning:\n1.  **Combination of Functions:** I've combined the Lorentzian (Cauchy) function from the original code (implicit in the denominator) with a Gaussian term (the exponential). This aims to create a function that has characteristics of both: heavy tails from the Lorentzian and a more concentrated peak from the Gaussian. The parameter `a` controls the width of the Gaussian.\n2.  **Parameterization:** The inclusion of `a` offers a degree of freedom for the optimization process to adjust the function's shape.\n3.  **Smoothness:** The resulting function is smooth, which is desirable for the integrals.\n4. **Gaussian to balance the heavy tails**: The gaussian will help balance the fact that the Cauchy distribution has heavy tails.\n\nNow, let's evolve it further. I'll add another parameter to control the weight of the gaussian against the Cauchy.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Modified function combining Cauchy and Gaussian, parameterized by 'a'\n    return math.exp(-0.5 * (x / a)**2) / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, b=1.0):\n    # Modified function combining Cauchy and Gaussian, parameterized by 'a' and 'b'\n    return b * math.exp(-0.5 * (x / a)**2) / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning:\n1. **Weighting Parameter:** I've introduced `b` as a weighting factor for the Gaussian part. This allows the optimization to control the relative influence of the Gaussian and Cauchy components, further tuning the function's behavior in both the spatial and frequency domains.\n2. **Flexibility:** This added parameter increases the flexibility of the function, allowing the optimizer to potentially find a better balance between `I1` and `I2`.\n3.  **Maintain smoothness:** The function remains smooth due to the properties of the Gaussian and the Lorentzian.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
