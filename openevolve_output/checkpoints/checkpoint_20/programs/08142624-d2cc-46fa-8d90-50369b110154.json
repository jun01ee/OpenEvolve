The current program uses a Gaussian function, which is a good starting point because it's smooth, has a well-defined Fourier transform (also Gaussian), and allows for analytical control of its spread via the parameter 'a'. The objective is to minimize the product of the variances in x-space and Fourier space, consistent with the uncertainty principle.\n\nThe existing code is already quite good, but we can explore a few refinements:\n\n1.  **Slightly different Gaussian Form:** While the current form is correct, we can rewrite the Gaussian function with a slightly different parameterization that may make the relationship between the parameter and the spread more explicit.
