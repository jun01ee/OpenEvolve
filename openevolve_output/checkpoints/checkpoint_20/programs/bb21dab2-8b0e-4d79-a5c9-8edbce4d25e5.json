This change uses `a`. This is a minor change but a good practice to demonstrate understanding of the parameter's effect on the width of the Gaussian in both position and momentum space and to avoid potential confusion with standard deviation.\n2.  **Normalization:** The main change is the inclusion of the normalization factor `(np.pi * a**2)**(-0.25)`. The previous code included a normalization constant inside the function. This version pre-normalizes the function to ensure the integral of |f(x)|^2 is 1. This ensures that the function is properly normalized. This is critical for the calculation of the integrals and will improve the fitness.\n3.  **Clarity:** The docstring is updated to reflect the new parameter and its effect.\n\nThis change aims to provide a more direct control over the function's width and assures proper normalization. This will help the evaluator by providing a well-defined function that can be easily used to calculate the integrals. This change is a good starting point for exploring other functions while keeping a good foundation.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
