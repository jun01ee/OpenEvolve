The core idea is to explore the parameter space a bit more, especially focusing on how `a` in `math.exp(-a*x*x)` affects the integrals and, consequently, the final score. Since the Gaussian form is already a good starting point, we'll try variations to refine this.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport cmath\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, b=1.0, phi=0.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family with phase and scaling: always safe, finite\n    return b * cmath.exp(-a*x*x + 1j*phi*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\nReasoning:\n\nThe original function uses only one parameter `a`.  We can enhance this function and, potentially, improve the performance by adding a scaling factor `b` and a phase factor `phi`. `b` allows for overall scaling and, more importantly, controlling the normalization, without changing the functional form itself. Adding `phi` introduces a complex exponential that will affect the fourier transform, giving additional flexibility. The inclusion of `cmath` allows using complex numbers, hence, taking into account the phase shift due to the use of `phi`. Since the Gaussian functions have analytical closed-form Fourier transforms, we should expect a relatively good score. These changes might result in exploring slightly different areas of the solution space for slightly better results, and therefore improved fitness.
