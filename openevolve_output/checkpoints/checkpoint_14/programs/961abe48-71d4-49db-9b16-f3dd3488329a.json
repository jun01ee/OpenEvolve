This is a reasonable starting point, as it's smooth and has a well-defined Fourier transform.  However, the objective function involves the product of position and momentum space spreads. The Gaussian function is known to *minimize* this product, according to the uncertainty principle. The Lorentzian, while smooth, does not have this property. Therefore, we should aim for a Gaussian-like function with a parameter to tune its width, or a function that is closely related to a Gaussian.\n\nHere's the suggested change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Lorentzian function, parameterized by 'a'\n    return 1 / (a*a + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (width)\n    return math.exp(-(x*x) / (2 * a*a))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning:\n\n1.  **Gaussian Form:** Replaced the Lorentzian with a Gaussian function: `math.exp(-(x*x) / (2 * a*a))`. This function is smooth, has a closed-form Fourier transform (another Gaussian), and is known to be optimal in minimizing the product of position and momentum space spreads.\n2.  **Parameterization:** The parameter `a` now controls the width of the Gaussian.  This allows the evolutionary algorithm to adjust the function's spread to minimize the objective function. The `a` parameter directly influences the widths in both position and frequency space. The optimal value of `a` will be determined by the numerical evaluation of the integrals.\n3.  **Efficiency:** This change maintains the simplicity and elegance of the original program while significantly improving its potential to achieve a good fitness score.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
