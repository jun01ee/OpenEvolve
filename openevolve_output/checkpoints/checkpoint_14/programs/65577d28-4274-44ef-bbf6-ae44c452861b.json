The current program uses `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x*x)`. This is a classic Cauchy distribution-like function. Let's think through how to improve this given the objective.\n\nThe objective involves minimizing the product of I1 and I2, subject to normalization. I1 is the integral of x^2 * |f(x)|^2 and I2 is the integral of \u03be^2 * |f\u0302(\u03be)|^2. This objective directly relates to the uncertainty principle, where minimizing both \"position spread\" (related to I1) and \"momentum spread\" (related to I2) is a key concept. The normalization condition acts as a constraint, forcing the function to have a fixed \"area\".\n\nThe current function is a good start, but it doesn't allow for much parameterization beyond scaling. Let's aim to use a function that is localized in both position and frequency space. Gaussian functions are ideal here. The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian. By adjusting the Gaussian's standard deviation, we can trade off between position spread and momentum spread. This allows us to search parameter space with a good analytical form and maintain smoothness.\n\nHere's a refined strategy:\n\n1.  **Gaussian:** Define a Gaussian function `f(x) = A * exp(-x^2 / (2 * sigma^2))`.\n2.  **Normalization:** Enforce the normalization constraint by finding the value of A that makes the integral of |f(x)|^2 equal to 1.\n3.  **Calculate Integrals:** Compute I1 and I2 analytically in terms of `sigma`.\n4.  **Optimization:** Since we have an analytical form, minimize Q = I1 * I2 over sigma. This could also be done symbolically (though it isn't necessary for the program to *perform* the symbolic optimization).\n5.  **Return function f(x).**\n\nLet's put this into code, step-by-step.\n\nHere's the code changes:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, sigma=1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function, normalized.\n    \"\"\"\n    A = 1.0 / (np.sqrt(2 * np.pi) * sigma)\n    return A * np.exp(-x*x / (2 * sigma*sigma))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    \"\"\"\n    Placeholder - the f() function itself will be the focus of the optimization.\n    The parameter \"sigma\" implicitly controls the optimization.\n    \"\"\"\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
