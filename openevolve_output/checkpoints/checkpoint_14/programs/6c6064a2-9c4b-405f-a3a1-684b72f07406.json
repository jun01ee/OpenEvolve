The goal is to minimize the product of two integrals related to the function and its Fourier transform. A narrower Gaussian in x-space leads to a wider Gaussian in frequency space, and vice-versa. We want to find a balance to minimize the product of the variances. Since the program already uses a Gaussian, it is likely doing reasonably well. To improve it, we could consider a more complex function that might offer more flexibility in shaping the function and controlling the trade-off between x and frequency domains. However, for now, let's stick with the Gaussian and explore a slightly different parameterization to see if it allows the evolutionary process to find a slightly better configuration, and keeps things analytically simple. I will add a phase factor, which should not affect the final fitness score too much, as its influence on I1 and I2 should be limited.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n=======\nimport cmath\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, phi=0.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family with phase: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x + 1j*phi*x)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
