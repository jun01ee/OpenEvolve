The current program utilizes a Gaussian function. The objective function involves the product of two integrals, `I1` (related to position space) and `I2` (related to Fourier space).  The Gaussian function is a good starting point because it has a well-defined Fourier transform, also a Gaussian. This inherent symmetry in position and frequency domains helps to minimize the product of the variances (as in the uncertainty principle). The normalization condition also helps. The `sigma` parameter provides a degree of freedom.\n\nThe main idea for improvement is to see how to maintain the core nature of the Gaussian and allow for more control on the variance. Let's incorporate a scaling parameter for the x variable, and a different prefactor to the gaussian.\n\nHere's the suggested change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function, normalized\n    sigma = 1.0  # Adjust for better performance.
