The goal is to minimize the product of two integrals, both involving the function and its Fourier transform. The Gaussian minimizes the uncertainty product, but introducing a more complex structure might improve the fitness, even if it is not immediately obvious.\n\nHere's an approach: Introduce a small perturbation to the Gaussian by adding a cosine term to it. This adds a degree of freedom and allows the optimization to potentially adjust the balance between the spatial and frequency domains. The cosine term modulates the Gaussian and might enable the function to reduce I1 while maintaining a similar I2.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, b=0.1):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family with a cosine modulation\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x) * (1 + b*math.cos(x))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
