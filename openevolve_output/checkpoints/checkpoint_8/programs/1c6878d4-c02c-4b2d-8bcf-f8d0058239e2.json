The current `f(x)` is `1 / (1 + x*x)`.  This is a Cauchy distribution (also known as a Lorentz distribution), and while it's a valid starting point, it's not the best choice for this particular optimization problem that focuses on minimizing a product of position-space and Fourier-space integral measures.  This suggests we need a function which is \"more localized\" both in space and in frequency.\n\nSpecifically, we want a function that has good concentration both in the x-domain and the Fourier domain. Given the problem structure which penalizes both x^2 and xi^2 weighting, we will likely find success with a Gaussian-like function as it minimizes the uncertainty product in the inequality we are trying to solve.  Let's consider the Gaussian, `f(x) = A * exp(-a*x*x)`.  The Fourier transform of a Gaussian is also a Gaussian, which gives us some symmetry in the space.  The key is the parameter `a`. It dictates the width of the Gaussian in both real and Fourier space.  The parameter 'A' can be chosen to ensure normalization.\n\nNow, let's craft the improvement using the `SEARCH/REPLACE` format.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function -  should be better behaved wrt integrals\n    a = 1.0  # Controls width - the optimization may modify this value\n    return (np.pi/a)**(-0.25) * np.exp(-0.5 * a * x*x)  # Includes normalization\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
