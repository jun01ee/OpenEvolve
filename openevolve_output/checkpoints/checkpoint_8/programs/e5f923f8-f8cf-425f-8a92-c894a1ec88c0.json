The normalization is crucial for the overall objective, as the integral of |f(x)|^2 must equal 1.  The added `(a/math.pi)**0.25` factor normalizes the Gaussian. While the evaluator will take care of this, adding the normalization improves the mathematical grounding.\n\n2.  **Parameterization:** The `a` parameter directly controls the width of the Gaussian.  This allows the evolutionary algorithm to explore different shapes that might be better suited to minimizing the product `I1 * I2`. The parameter a is already in the original code, so this is a minimal change.\n\n3.  **Smoothness and Safety:** The function remains smooth (infinitely differentiable) and numerically safe, avoiding any potential issues with division by zero or undefined operations.  The exponential function is well-behaved.\n\n4.  **Closed-form Integrability:** Gaussian functions have closed-form Fourier transforms (also Gaussian).  This structure is ideal for the problem, as it should lead to well-defined values for `I1` and `I2` and good performance.\n\nThis approach provides a well-defined starting point with a clear mathematical structure, encouraging the evolutionary algorithm to explore the parameter space for potentially better fitness. The improvement should come from a more accurate evaluation of `I1` and `I2`, and the normalized form will allow for a more direct comparison of different parameter choices.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
