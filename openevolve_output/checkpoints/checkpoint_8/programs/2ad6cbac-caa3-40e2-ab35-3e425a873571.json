The objective involves minimizing the product of two integrals: one in real space (I1) and one in Fourier space (I2), under a normalization constraint. The current program uses a Gaussian function. This is a reasonable starting point because Gaussians are well-behaved, smooth, and have a known Fourier transform (also a Gaussian). The product I1*I2 for a Gaussian is directly related to its width in real space, and the width in frequency space (also Gaussian in this case). The uncertainty principle suggests that minimizing this product can be achieved by balancing the widths in the two spaces, though the Gaussian *already* does this.\n\nThe previous attempts show that Gaussians and similar functions are being used with a focus on parameter 'a'.\n\nThe strategy here should focus on functions that have known relationships between spatial and spectral localization. The current program could perhaps be made better, potentially. A more elaborate function could maybe beat Gaussian with tuning.\n\nHere's an attempt. Let's incorporate a parameter 'a' to control the width, as done in some previous attempts. Let us change the form to use a modified Gaussian with a different normalization constant.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function - well localized\n    return np.exp(-x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function - well localized\n    a = 1.0 # Parameter for width, to be tuned.\n    return (1 / (a * np.sqrt(np.pi))) * np.exp(-(x/a)**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
