The key parameter to tune is `sigma`, which controls the width of the Gaussian. A smaller `sigma` leads to a narrower function in position space (smaller `var_x`), but a wider function in momentum space (larger `var_xi`). Conversely, a larger `sigma` leads to a wider function in position space and a narrower one in momentum space. The goal is to find a balance.\n\nThe current `sigma` is `width / 4.0`. Let's explore values of `sigma` that are larger than this, as suggested by the \"Diverse Programs\" and \"Inspiration Programs\" which achieved the same score with larger `sigma` values. This suggests that increasing `sigma` might further reduce the momentum variance (`var_xi`) without increasing the position variance (`var_x`) too much, thus improving the overall fitness.\n\nSpecifically, Program 2 uses `sigma = width / 3.0` and Program D1 uses `sigma = width / 2.5`. Both achieved the same score, but their `var_x` and `var_xi` values differ. We can try a value between these two, or even slightly larger than `width / 2.5` to see if we can further push down `var_xi`.\n\nLet's try increasing `sigma` to `width / 2.0`. This is a significant change towards a wider Gaussian in position space, which *should* lead to a narrower Gaussian in momentum space.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    width = 2.0\n    # Initialize with zeros\n    y = np.zeros_like(x, dtype=np.complex128)\n    \n    # Replace boxcar with a Gaussian\n    sigma = width / 4.0 # Adjust sigma to control the width of the Gaussian\n    y = np.exp(-x**2 / (2 * sigma**2)) + 0.0j\n=======\n    width = 2.0\n    # Initialize with zeros\n    y = np.zeros_like(x, dtype=np.complex128)\n    \n    # Replace boxcar with a Gaussian\n    # Increasing sigma to widen the Gaussian in position space,\n    # aiming to narrow it in momentum space and reduce the uncertainty product.\n    sigma = width / 2.0 # Wider Gaussian in position space\n    y = np.exp(-x**2 / (2 * sigma**2)) + 0.0j\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
