However, it's not well-suited for the problem because it doesn't concentrate its energy well in both the position and frequency domains. The goal is to minimize the product of the \"uncertainty\" in position and frequency, which is closely related to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. A Gaussian function is the canonical minimizer of this uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the main improvement will be to change the function to a Gaussian. We'll also provide a parameter to control the width of the Gaussian, allowing for some flexibility in the optimization process. This parameter will be a positive real number.\n\nHere's the suggested diff:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gaussian function, parameterized by 'a' (width).\n    \"\"\"\n    return (np.pi * a**2)**(-0.25) * np.exp(-(x**2) / (2 * a**2))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
