This is a reasonable starting point, but it's not ideal for minimizing the uncertainty product Q. This function is a Lorentzian, which has heavy tails in both the x-space and Fourier space.  We want to find functions that are more concentrated, ideally close to a Gaussian, as this minimizes the uncertainty product.  The Lorentzian's Fourier transform is also a Lorentzian, which is why it doesn't perform well in this scenario.\n\nHere's how we can improve the program:\n\n1.  **Change the Functional Form:** Replace the Lorentzian with a Gaussian function. A Gaussian function is known to minimize the uncertainty principle, making it a good candidate.\n2.  **Parameterization:** Introduce a parameter to control the width of the Gaussian (sigma). This allows the optimization process to find the optimal width.\n\nHere's the code with the proposed changes:\n\n```python\n# initial_program.py\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function with a parameter for width\n    sigma = 1.0  # Initial guess for the standard deviation (width)\n    return (1 / (sigma * (2 * 3.141592653589793)**0.5)) *  2.718281828459045**(-(x**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n```\n\nNow the `SEARCH/REPLACE` diffs:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x**2)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function with a parameter for width\n    sigma = 1.0  # Initial guess for the standard deviation (width)\n    return (1 / (sigma * (2 * 3.141592653589793)**0.5)) *  2.718281828459045**(-(x**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning:\nThe original program used a Lorentzian function. This change replaces it with a Gaussian function. The Gaussian function is known to minimize the uncertainty product, which is the optimization target. A parameter `sigma` is included to allow tuning the function's width. The scaling factor is included for proper normalization.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
