The provided `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x*x)` is a decent starting point. It's a smooth, decaying function, and its Fourier transform is also well-behaved. However, we can likely improve its performance by making it more \"compact\" in both the spatial and frequency domains, aiming to reduce the product I1 * I2, while preserving normalization.\n\nThe core concept is to manipulate f(x) to concentrate it, reducing spread, which indirectly compacts its Fourier transform too. A Gaussian, or functions related to Gaussian, are optimal for the uncertainty principle which relates to our cost function.\n\nHere's my plan, and let's go with a modification using a Gaussian-like function:\n1.  **Gaussian Core:** We replace the current function with a Gaussian.  A Gaussian is the eigenfunction of the Fourier Transform and minimizes the uncertainty.\n2.  **Normalization:** The current definition does not include a normalization constant, so we explicitly include a normalization factor to make sure that the total integral of |f(x)|^2 dx = 1.\n\nHere's the first set of changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function, normalized\n    sigma = 1.0  # Adjust for better performance.
