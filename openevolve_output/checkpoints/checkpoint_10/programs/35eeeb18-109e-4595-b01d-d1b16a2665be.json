The Gaussian minimizes the product of the variances in position and momentum (Fourier transform space). However, the default parameter `a=1.0` might not be optimal for minimizing the given objective function `Q`. Let's introduce a search over parameter `a` to potentially improve the fitness. Although a true \"search\" is forbidden inside the program itself, we can recognize that parameter `a` is a key ingredient and leave it accessible for external tuning.\n\nThe program defines `f(x, a=1.0)`. The `a` parameter controls the width of the Gaussian in the x-domain. Varying `a` changes the spread of the function and therefore affects both integrals I1 and I2. Because the problem statement asks to *minimize* the product of I1 and I2 and is also subject to the normalization constraint, finding the correct value of parameter `a` is the key. The function f is still smooth and well-behaved, admitting closed-form expressions (at least, their integrals are easily sampled by the external evaluator).\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
