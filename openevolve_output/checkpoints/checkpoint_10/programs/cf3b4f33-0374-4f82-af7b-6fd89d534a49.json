The current function `f(x)` is a Lorentzian function. This function has some nice properties: it's smooth, it decays to zero as x goes to infinity, and it has a well-defined Fourier transform (also a Lorentzian). This makes it a reasonable starting point.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the product `Q = I1 * I2`, where `I1` is the integral of `x^2 |f(x)|^2` and `I2` is the integral of `\u03be^2 |f\u0302(\u03be)|^2`. We know that the Gaussian function minimizes the uncertainty product, and the Lorentzian function has a relatively large \"uncertainty\" (it's Fourier transform is another Lorentzian). Therefore, a Gaussian should give a lower result.\n\nInstead of a Gaussian, which has been attempted before, I will introduce a parameterization of the Lorentzian to see if we can get a better outcome by modifying its \"spread\".\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function\n    return 1 / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function\n    return 1 / (1 + a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
