While it's a good starting point, it's inefficient.  The function `f(x) = x**x` has a clear minimum.  We can improve the search by:\n\n1.  **Narrowing the Search Range:** The function's minimum is around x=0.3678.  The original code searches from 1e-5 to 2.0.  We can get better results by focusing the search closer to the minimum.\n2.  **More Iterations:**  Increase the number of iterations to explore the search space more thoroughly.\n3.  **Local Refinement (optional):** After the initial random search, we could add a local refinement step (e.g., a small step around the best found x) to potentially find a better minimum. This is not implemented here for simplicity, but it's a good future improvement.\n\nHere's the improved code:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    best_x = 1.0\n    best_val = best_x ** best_x\n    for _ in range(50):\n        x = random.uniform(1e-5, 2.0)\n        val = x ** x\n        if val < best_val:\n            best_x, best_val = x, val\n    return best_x\n=======\n    best_x = 1.0\n    best_val = best_x ** best_x\n    for _ in range(100):\n        x = random.uniform(0.1, 0.6)  # Narrowed search range\n        val = x ** x\n        if val < best_val:\n            best_x, best_val = x, val\n    return best_x\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
