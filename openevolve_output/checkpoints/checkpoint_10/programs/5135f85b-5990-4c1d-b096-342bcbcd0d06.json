The current program uses `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x*x)`. This function is smooth, and its Fourier transform decays relatively slowly (algebraically). This could lead to a less-than-optimal value for Q, as it might not be well-localized in both position and frequency space.\n\nThe goal is to minimize I1 * I2, subject to the normalization constraint. This is essentially an uncertainty principle problem. The optimal solution should be a function that balances its spread in both the x and \u03be domains. Gaussians are known to minimize the uncertainty principle, and their Fourier transforms are also Gaussians.  Therefore, I will modify the function to a Gaussian function.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Introduce `import numpy as np`**: This is needed for the Gaussian exponential and its normalization factor.\n2.  **Define a Gaussian:** Replace the current `f(x)` definition with a Gaussian.  Include a scaling parameter 'a' for tuning the width of the Gaussian (which influences both I1 and I2).  Use `np.exp` for the exponential.  Properly normalize the Gaussian using `1 / np.sqrt(a * np.pi)`.\n\nHere's the code changes:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function - to be optimized through OpenEvolve\n    # Introduce a scaling parameter 'a' to control width, for OpenEvolve to tune\n    a = 1.0  # Initial width parameter.
