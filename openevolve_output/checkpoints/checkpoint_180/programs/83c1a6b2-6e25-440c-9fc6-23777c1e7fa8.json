These sharp edges lead to a broad distribution in momentum space (high momentum variance), resulting in a large Heisenberg Uncertainty Product.\n\nThe goal is to minimize the Uncertainty Product, and it is a known quantum mechanical principle that a Gaussian wave packet minimizes this product. The previous successful attempts and inspiration programs confirm this, achieving a fitness of 0.0063 by using a Gaussian function.\n\nTherefore, the most effective improvement is to replace the boxcar function with a Gaussian function. This will smooth out the wave function, significantly reducing its momentum variance and thus the uncertainty product. A `sigma` value of `0.5` has been shown to be effective in the top-performing programs.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initial guess: A simple rectangular box function (Boxcar)\n    # This is far from optimal (sharp edges = high frequency components)\n    \n    width = 2.0\n    # Initialize with zeros\n    y = np.zeros_like(x, dtype=np.complex128)\n    \n    # Create the box\n    mask = (x > -width/2) & (x < width/2)\n    y[mask] = 1.0 + 0.0j\n=======\n    # A Gaussian function is known to minimize the uncertainty product.\n    # Replacing the sharp-edged box with a smooth Gaussian will drastically reduce momentum variance.\n    # Sigma controls the spread of the Gaussian.
