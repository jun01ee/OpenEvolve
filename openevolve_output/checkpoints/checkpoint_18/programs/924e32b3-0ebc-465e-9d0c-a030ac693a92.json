The current program utilizes a Lorentzian function, which, while having some nice properties (smoothness, decay), isn't necessarily optimal for minimizing the product of the position and momentum variances, Q = I1 * I2.  A Gaussian function is the standard minimizer of the uncertainty product, achieving the equality case of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Therefore, we should shift towards a Gaussian.\n\nHere's the breakdown of my approach:\n\n1.  **Replace Lorentzian with Gaussian:** The core change will be replacing the Lorentzian function with a Gaussian.  A Gaussian, characterized by a quadratic dependence in the exponent, will minimize the uncertainty product.\n2.  **Parameterization:** Introduce a parameter, `sigma`, to control the width (and thus the variance) of the Gaussian.\n\nHere's the code changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Parameterized Lorentzian function\n    a = 1.0  # Introduce a parameter for scaling\n    return 1 / (1 + (x/a)**2)\n=======\n    # Parameterized Gaussian function\n    sigma = 1.0  # Standard deviation\n    return (1 / (sigma * (2 * 3.14159)**0.5)) *  2.71828**(-(x**2) / (2 * sigma**2))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
