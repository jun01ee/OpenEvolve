The current program uses a Gaussian function. This is a good starting point because it's smooth, well-behaved in both the spatial and frequency domains, and amenable to closed-form calculations (or at least, numerically tractable). However, to improve the fitness score, we want to explore other families of functions. The score is calculated based on I1 * I2, where I1 represents the spread in position and I2 represents the spread in the frequency domain. We want to aim for a balance here to minimize the product. A Gaussian achieves this, but perhaps a different family can optimize the product slightly better.\n\nOne way to explore is to use a modified Gaussian (e.g. involving Hermite polynomials for deviations from a simple Gaussian, or something involving trigonometric terms). However, because the system should be simple, and the evaluation is numerical, rather than closed-form, let's stick with the parametric Gaussian, but use a more complicated parameterization.\n\nHere are the changes:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return math.exp(-a*x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, b=0.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite, added parameter\n    return math.exp(-a * (x - b) * (x - b))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nReasoning for changes:\n1.  **Added a `b` parameter:** The original code had only the `a` parameter controlling the width of the Gaussian. Introducing a `b` parameter allows for a shift in the Gaussian's center.  While the integral expressions are invariant to shifts, introducing a second parameter gives the evolutionary process a degree of freedom and may help find a better solution. The shifted Gaussian does not introduce any risks or edge cases since it is still bounded and smooth.\n\n2.  **Updated `f(x)` definition:** Incorporated the `b` parameter in the gaussian function definition. The core functional form remains unchanged: Gaussian, and is still always safe.\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
