The current program defines a Gaussian function, `f(x) = b * exp(-a*x*x)`. This is a good starting point because it is smooth, mathematically well-defined, and admits closed-form solutions for the integrals involved in the fitness calculation (I1, I2).  The parameters 'a' and 'b' control the width and amplitude of the Gaussian, which directly influences the values of I1, I2, and the combined fitness.\n\nThe goal is to minimize Q = I1 * I2 subject to the normalization constraint.  For a Gaussian, the product of I1 and I2, related to the time-bandwidth product, is minimized.  The existing program is very close to optimal.  However, let's explore adding a phase term, as seen in Program D2. Adding a phase term can shift the function and potentially lead to a slightly better solution by adjusting the balance between I1 and I2, within the normalization constraint. Although the current gaussian is already an eigenfunction, a small phase can provide more diversity.\n\nHere's the planned change:\n1.  Introduce a new parameter, `phi`, to control a phase factor.\n2.  Add the phase term inside the `exp` function.\n\nThis change aims to explore the function space more effectively and provides the ability for more fine-grained control to possibly achieve a more optimal balance of I1 and I2.\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x, a=1.0, b=1.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family: always safe, finite\n    return b * math.exp(-a*x*x)\n=======\nimport cmath\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0, b=1.0, phi=0.0):\n    # Parametric Gaussian family with phase: always safe, finite\n    return b * cmath.exp(-a*x*x + 1j*phi*x)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
