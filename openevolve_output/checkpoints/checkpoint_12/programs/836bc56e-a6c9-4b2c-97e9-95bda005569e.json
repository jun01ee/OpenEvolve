The provided function `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x*x)` is a reasonable starting point. It's smooth, decays nicely, and we can intuitively guess that it will work fairly well in the integrals. Its Fourier transform will also decay, suggesting a good overall behavior. However, we can enhance the function's structure using our Fourier analysis understanding to potentially improve its fitness and introduce parameterization.\n\nThe objective is to minimize a product of two integrals, representing position and momentum space concentration, subject to normalization. This relates to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  A Gaussian function is the classic minimizer for this principle. While the current function resembles a Lorentzian, we can directly incorporate a Gaussian and test how it changes the fitness. Let's try to adapt the function to something with a bit more flexibility and, critically, a free parameter controlling the width. I will use a parameterized Gaussian as my next candidate.\n\nHere's the planned approach:\n1.  **Introduce a parameter `a`:** This will control the width of the Gaussian, allowing the optimization process to explore a range of functions with different concentration properties. The function should maintain smoothness and be analytically sound.\n\n2.  **Define `f(x)` as a Gaussian:**  Implement `f(x) = (1/(a*sqrt(2*pi))) * exp(-(x/a)**2 / 2)`. This form will introduce a scale factor in both position and frequency domains, directly tied to the uncertainty principle.\n3.  **No changes needed to `search_algorithm`**: it simply returns `f`.\n\nNow, let's implement the changes using the specified `SEARCH/REPLACE` format.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport math\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Gaussian function with parameter a (width)\n    return (1.0 / (a * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi))) * math.exp(-(x*x) / (2 * a*a))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
