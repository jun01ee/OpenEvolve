The current `f(x)` is `1 / (1 + x*x)`.  This function is a good starting point as it's smooth and decays reasonably well. However, let's try to refine it further and add a parameter. Based on the problem description, we want to minimize the product of two integrals, `I1` and `I2`, with a normalization constraint. `I1` involves the function multiplied by `x^2`, and `I2` involves the Fourier transform and multiplication by `\u03be^2`.  This suggests a connection to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  A Gaussian function minimizes the uncertainty product. But a Lorentzian is a better starting point given the current function structure.  We should investigate other parameterizations.\n\nLet's modify the program to include a parameter `a` to scale the width of the Lorentzian.\n\nHere's the planned modification:\n\n1.  Introduce a parameter `a` inside the definition of the function `f(x)`. This `a` parameter will control the \"width\" of the function and therefore impact the integrals.\n2.
