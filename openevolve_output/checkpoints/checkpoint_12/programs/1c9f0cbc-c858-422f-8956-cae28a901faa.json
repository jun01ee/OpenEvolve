The current program uses `f(x) = 1 / (1 + x*x)`. This is a classic Cauchy distribution (scaled and shifted), and is known to have some nice properties in terms of Fourier transforms. However, the Cauchy distribution does not have finite variance or standard deviation in the *x* domain, so its behavior under the problem's integrals might be unfavorable.\n\nTo improve the score, we want to balance the \"spread\" of the function in both the *x* domain and the Fourier domain (\u03be domain).  We are optimizing for the product of variances (or more precisely, related quantities) in these domains. This is suggestive of an uncertainty principle-type relationship. A Gaussian function often provides a good trade-off between localization in both domains, in the sense that a Gaussian function is its own Fourier transform (up to scaling).\n\nTherefore, let's try a Gaussian. We want it to be normalized and parameterizable for the optimization process.\n\nHere's the planned modification.\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\n\ndef f(x):\n    # Gaussian function - to be optimized through OpenEvolve\n    # Introduce a scaling parameter 'a' to control width, for OpenEvolve to tune\n    a = 1.0  # Initial width parameter.
