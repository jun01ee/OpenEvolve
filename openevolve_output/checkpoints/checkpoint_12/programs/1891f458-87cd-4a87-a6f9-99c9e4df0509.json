The current program uses a simple Lorentzian function, `1 / (1 + x*x)`.  This is a reasonable starting point. We need to consider how to make f(x) better with respect to the uncertainty principle, meaning we need to balance the spread in x-space with the spread in k-space (Fourier space). The goal is to minimize the product of I1 and I2, under the constraint of the normalization. This suggests we should think about functions that are reasonably well-localized in both spaces.\n\nThe current Lorentzian has a very slow decay in both x and k space, which is not ideal for the minimization objective. We want a function that has rapid decay in both spaces.\n\nLet's explore a modified Gaussian, and how it interacts with the uncertainty relation.  We know that a Gaussian is its own Fourier transform.  Let's consider a Gaussian and a parameter for its width.\nWe can try changing the existing Lorentzian into Gaussian, as a starting point. We can then add a parameter for adjusting Gaussian's width.\n\nHere's my proposed change:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\ndef f(x):\n    # Very simple initial guess \n    return 1 / (1 + x*x)\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n=======\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x, a=1.0):\n    # Gaussian function, with adjustable width\n    return np.exp(-(x*x) / (2 * a*a))\n\ndef search_algorithm():\n    # For this problem, return f itself.\n    # OpenEvolve will mutate the f() body, not this function.\n    return f\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n"]}}, "artifacts_json": null, "artifact_dir": null, "embedding": null}
